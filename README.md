# 🏗️ ROOTED Meta Infrastructure — Systems, Civic Architecture & Platform Backbones

A meta-layer vertical explaining the **infrastructure of ROOTED itself**  
and how it interfaces with civic, environmental, and digital systems.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

Includes:

- “How the city works” explainers  
- ROOTED system diagrams (public-friendly)  
- Infrastructure process education (water → energy → waste → transit)  
- Responsible technology transparency  
- Civic architecture visualizations  
- Public systems literacy for families  

This vertical is **NOT**:

- A developer doc repo  
- A backend engineering manual  
- A political platform  
- A municipal operations dashboard  

It is meant for **public understanding**, not internal engineering.
